Now three nodes perform operations:

| Node | Operation | Token |
|------|-----------|-------|
| A | key1 = "B" | 1 |
| B | key1 = "C" | 2 |
| C | key1 = "D" | 3 |

Due to network delay, operation 1 (token=1) arrives after 2 and 3.

**How does the DB decide what's valid?**

It simply picks the operation with the **highest token value**.

✅ **Final value of key1 = "D"** (token 3)
🚫 Writes from tokens 1 and 2 are ignored (stale)

This keeps the system strongly consistent, regardless of message delays.

## 🧱 5. Implementation Breakdown

Let's look at how fencing tokens are actually implemented.

### 🔹 (a) Token Generation
Usually handled by a central coordination service.

**Common mechanisms:**
- Monotonic counters
- Logical clocks
- Zookeeper's zxid or znode version
- etcd's revision numbers

### 🔹 (b) Token Distribution
The token is given along with a lock lease or session grant. The client attaches this token in all requests to shared resources.

### 🔹 (c) Token Comparison
The resource server tracks the latest token it accepted for each resource.

**Before processing a request:**
- If token < last_seen_token, reject request
- If token >= last_seen_token, process and update last_seen_token

### 🔹 (d) Failure Handling
Even if a client crashes, retries, or reconnects, newer clients get higher tokens — so stale clients can never overwrite new data.

## ⚖️ 6. Benefits of Fencing Tokens

| Benefit | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| Prevents race conditions | Ensures no two clients overwrite each other's work |
| Eliminates stale writes | Old processes with expired locks can't corrupt new data |
| Maintains strong consistency | Updates happen in a globally ordered sequence |
| Improves reliability | System behaves predictably even under failure or delay |
| Supports concurrency safely | Allows multiple clients to coexist without corrupting shared state |

## ⚠️ 7. Common Challenges

| Challenge | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| Token persistence | Resource servers must persist "last seen token" to disk, or restarts could cause stale acceptance |
| Clock independence | Tokens must not rely on wall-clock time; use monotonic counters instead |
| Coordination service failure | If Zookeeper or etcd fails, token generation must resume correctly to avoid duplicates |
| Scalability tradeoff | Centralized token generation can become a bottleneck in massive systems |

## 🌍 8. Real-World Systems Using Fencing Tokens

### 🔹 1. Zookeeper
Each znode (data node) has a version number. When you modify data, your write includes the expected version. If your version doesn't match the current one, your write is rejected — effectively acting as a fencing token mechanism.

### 🔹 2. etcd (used in Kubernetes)
Each operation has a revision number — a globally increasing integer. This acts as the fencing token, ensuring newer writes always override older ones safely.

### 🔹 3. Distributed Filesystems (HDFS, Ceph)
Clients use fencing tokens to make sure old lease holders cannot corrupt newer writes during leader failover or network partitions.

### 🔹 4. Databases & Messaging Systems
Systems like PostgreSQL clusters, Kafka brokers, and RabbitMQ use fencing tokens (or similar monotonic sequence numbers) for ordering replication updates.

## 💡 9. Real-World Use Case Scenarios

### 🏦 Banking Transactions
**Problem:** Thousands of concurrent debit/credit operations.
**Fencing tokens** guarantee transactions are processed in the exact order they were issued — preventing overdrafts or double-spends.

### 🛒 E-commerce Inventory
**Problem:** Two users buying the last item simultaneously.
**Fencing tokens** ensure only the latest valid update (with the highest token) changes the stock, preventing "overselling."

### ☁️ Cloud Resource Management
**Problem:** Multiple services scaling the same VM cluster.
**Fencing tokens** ensure no stale scaling request (like "add 2 servers" from an old client) executes after a newer "reduce to 5 servers" command.

## 🧩 10. Summary Table

| Concept | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| Definition | Monotonically increasing unique ID attached to each lock/operation |
| Purpose | Prevent stale writes, enforce operation ordering |
| Generated By | Coordination services (Zookeeper, etcd, lock managers) |
| Checked By | Resource servers before executing operations |
| Order Guarantee | Higher token = more recent operation |
| Use Cases | Distributed DBs, File Systems, Cloud Controllers, Leader Elections |

## 🧠 11. Key Takeaways

- **Fencing Tokens = sequence numbers for distributed locks**
- They ensure safety even when leases expire, clients retry, or networks delay messages
- They work without clocks, using monotonic counters for total order
- They're simple, robust, and essential in any distributed system requiring coordination

## ⚙️ Example Pseudocode

```python
# Centralized Token Issuer
token = 0
def acquire_lock(client_id):
    global token
    token += 1
    return token

# Resource Server
last_seen_token = 0
def write_request(client_token, data):
    global last_seen_token
    if client_token < last_seen_token:
        reject("Stale request")
    else:
        apply(data)
        last_seen_token = client_token
```

## 🧩 Analogy Recap (To Remember Easily)

| Real World | Distributed System |
|------------|-------------------|
| Queue token in amusement park | Fencing token in distributed lock |
| Ride turn order | Operation order |
| Guard checking token number | Resource server verifying fencing token |
| Latecomer with old ticket | Stale client with old lease |
| Ride proceeds safely | Data consistency maintained |

## 🚀 Final Summary (TL;DR)

**Fencing Tokens** are monotonic sequence numbers attached to distributed lock holders to prevent stale or conflicting operations. They guarantee ordering, consistency, and safety across nodes — even under failures, delays, or retries.

**Core concept:**
> "Higher token wins; lower token gets fenced out."
