# Partitioning vs. Sharding

## Partitioning ‚Äî Splitting data within a single database

### Definition

Partitioning means breaking a large table into smaller, more manageable chunks called partitions, all within the same database instance.

Each partition stores a subset of the total data but follows the same schema (same columns and structure).
To your application, it still looks like one big table ‚Äî but internally, the database knows which partition to look into for faster access.

### Why Partition?

Databases partition large tables mainly to:

- Improve performance ‚Äî queries scan less data (fewer rows = faster results).
- Improve manageability ‚Äî backups, indexing, and maintenance can be done on smaller chunks.
- Enable parallelism ‚Äî different partitions can be queried or processed in parallel, using multiple CPU cores.

### Example

Imagine a transactions table that stores all payments since 2015. Over time, it's grown to billions of rows.

Instead of one massive table:

You divide it by year ‚Üí
- `transactions_2022`
- `transactions_2023`
- `transactions_2024`
Now, a query like
```sql
SELECT * FROM transactions WHERE year = 2024;
```
will only scan the 2024 partition ‚Äî not all years combined. This drastically reduces I/O and speeds up results.

### Common Partitioning Strategies

| Type | How it works | Example |
|------|--------------|---------|
| Range Partitioning | Divide rows by numeric or date ranges | Transactions before 2024 vs. after 2024 |
| List Partitioning | Divide by a list of predefined values | Orders by region: Asia, Europe, US |
| Hash Partitioning | Use a hash function on a key to spread rows evenly | `hash(user_id) % 4` ‚Üí 4 partitions |
| Composite Partitioning | Combine methods (e.g., range + hash) | Range by year, hash by user_id inside each |

üü¢ **Key idea:**
Partitioning optimizes performance within a single database instance.
It does not increase total system capacity beyond that single database's limits.

## Sharding ‚Äî Splitting data across multiple databases

### Definition

Sharding is like partitioning on steroids.
It's the process of splitting your data horizontally across multiple database servers, where each shard is a completely independent database ‚Äî with its own CPU, memory, and storage.

Each shard holds a distinct subset of the total data.

### Why Shard?

Sharding becomes essential when:

- The data grows beyond what one machine can handle.
- The number of requests exceeds a single DB's processing capacity.
- You want to reduce latency by storing data close to the users (geo-distribution).
- You need fault isolation ‚Äî if one shard fails, others keep serving.

### Example (Facebook)

Facebook stores users' data on regional shards:

- Users in Australia ‚Üí Australian shard (Sydney data center).
- Users in the US ‚Üí US shard (Virginia data center).

This setup ensures:

- Low latency (nearby servers respond faster).
- If one region goes down, others remain unaffected.
- Workload distribution across the globe.

### Shard Key

A shard key decides where each record goes ‚Äî which shard will store it.

Common shard key choices:

- User ID hash ‚Üí balances data evenly.
- Region/Country ‚Üí groups users geographically (good for latency, risky for uneven load).

‚ö†Ô∏è **Bad shard key = "hot shard"**
If one shard gets way more requests than others, it becomes a bottleneck (e.g., all Indian users on one shard).

### Types of Sharding

| Type | Meaning | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Horizontal Sharding | Split rows across multiple DBs | Users A‚ÄìM ‚Üí DB1, Users N‚ÄìZ ‚Üí DB2 |
| Vertical Sharding | Split columns (attributes) across DBs | User profile data ‚Üí DB1, User posts ‚Üí DB2 |

## Fundamental Difference

| Feature | Partitioning | Sharding |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| Scope | Within one database | Across multiple databases/servers |
| Goal | Improve query speed & manageability | Improve scalability & fault isolation |
| Key used | Partition key (e.g., date, ID range) | Shard key (e.g., user ID, region) |
| Complexity | Easier to maintain | More complex (routing, balancing, replication) |
| Failure impact | Whole DB still affected | One shard fails ‚Üí rest unaffected |

## When to Use Which

| Use Case | Choose |
|----------|--------|
| Large tables slowing down queries | Partitioning |
| Need better backup/archiving | Partitioning |
| Database can't fit on one machine anymore | Sharding |
| Global users with high latency | Sharding |
| Need high throughput & fault isolation | Sharding |

## In Short

- **Partitioning** = Split data within one database to make it faster and easier to manage.
- **Sharding** = Split data across multiple databases to scale horizontally and handle global load.

Or, even simpler:

- Partitioning improves query performance.
- Sharding improves system scalability.

## Analogy (for intuition)

Imagine a library:

- **Partitioning** = Dividing one huge library into labeled sections (Fiction, History, Science) ‚Äî still one building, just better organized.
- **Sharding** = Building multiple libraries across different cities ‚Äî each with its own subset of books and staff.
