# 🧠 Caching 

## 🧩 1. What is a Cache?

A **cache** is a small, high-speed storage layer that stores copies of frequently accessed data to provide faster access than the main storage (RAM, disk, or database).

Think of it as a shortcut memory between the processor (or application) and the main storage.

### 🔹 Example — Real-Life Analogy

Your home has:
- **Almirah (Closet):** Stores rarely used items (e.g., blankets, suits). Large but slow to access.
- **Wardrobe/Dressing Table:** Keeps daily-use items (t-shirts, combs). Smaller but much faster to reach.

**Similarly:**
- Main Memory / Database = Large, slower storage
- Cache = Small, faster storage for frequently used data

So instead of fetching from the "big, slow" storage every time, we fetch from the cache.

## ⚙️ 2. Why Do We Need Caches?

- **Speed:** Cache access time ≈ nanoseconds; main memory ≈ microseconds.
- **Reduced Latency:** Avoid frequent trips to slower memory or disk.
- **Lower Load:** Reduces requests hitting the main memory/database.
- **Improved Throughput:** The system can handle more operations per second.

## 🧭 3. Key Principles of Caching

### 1. Temporal Locality
If data is accessed once, it's likely to be accessed again soon.  
**Example:** You wear a new suit multiple times right after buying it before storing it away.

### 2. Spatial Locality
If a particular memory address is accessed, nearby addresses are likely to be accessed soon.  
**Example:** If you open a drawer for a shirt, you might also pick socks from the same place.

## 🧱 4. Technical Definition

A **cache** is a smaller, faster storage that temporarily holds copies of data from slower storage (RAM or disk) to provide faster access to frequently used data or instructions.

## 🧮 5. Types of CPU Caches

| Cache Level | Location | Size | Speed | Purpose |
|-------------|----------|------|-------|----------|
| L1 Cache | Inside CPU Core | Smallest (~32–128KB) | Fastest | Stores recently accessed data/instructions |
| L2 Cache | Between CPU and Main Memory | Medium (~256KB–2MB) | Slower than L1 | Additional buffer if L1 misses |
| L3 Cache | Shared across CPU cores | Large (~4–32MB) | Slowest of caches | Shared storage to improve inter-core communication |

## 🔄 6. Cache Replacement Policies

When the cache is full and new data arrives, the system must decide which old data to replace.

### 1. LRU (Least Recently Used)
Replaces the item that has not been accessed for the longest time.  
Based on temporal locality.

**🧩 Example:**  
Cache = [4, 3, 7, 9]  
If 8 comes → Replace 9 (least recently used).

### 2. FIFO (First In, First Out)
The earliest added item is replaced first.  
Ignores access frequency or recency.

**🧩 Example:**  
Cache = [9, 7, 3, 4]  
When 8 arrives → Remove 9 (added first).

### 3. MRU (Most Recently Used)
Opposite of LRU.  
Replaces the most recently used item.  
Useful for patterns where recent data is less likely to be reused.

### 4. LFU (Least Frequently Used)
Replaces data used least often.  
Tracks frequency count of access.  
Works well when access patterns are stable.

### 5. Random Replacement
Randomly evicts an item.  
Simple but can lead to poor performance in some cases.  
Sometimes used in hardware for speed reasons.

## ✍️ 7. Cache Write Policies

When we write (update) data, we must decide how and when that change is propagated to the main memory or database.

### 1. Write-Through
Write happens to both cache and database simultaneously.

**✅ Advantages:**
- Data in cache and DB always consistent.
- No risk of data loss if cache fails.

**⚠️ Disadvantages:**
- Slower writes (must update both).
- Higher latency and resource usage.

**🧰 Use Case:**  
Financial systems, banking, or inventory — where consistency > speed.

### 2. Write-Back (Write-Behind)
Write happens only in cache first, and later asynchronously to the database.

**✅ Advantages:**
- Very low write latency.
- Handles heavy write load efficiently.

**⚠️ Disadvantages:**
- Risk of data loss if cache crashes before DB sync.
- Requires background synchronization management.

**🧰 Use Case:**  
Web applications, session stores, analytics — where small data loss is tolerable.

### 3. Write-Around
Write bypasses the cache and goes directly to the database.  
The cache entry (if present) is invalidated.

**✅ Advantages:**
- Prevents cache pollution with rarely used data.
- Efficient for infrequent writes.

**⚠️ Disadvantages:**
- Read-after-write may cause cache miss → slower read.

**🧰 Use Case:**  
Archival systems, logging systems, or append-only data.

### 4. Refresh-Ahead
Cache proactively refreshes entries before they expire.

**✅ Advantages:**
- Fewer cache misses.
- Improved performance for frequently accessed data.

**⚠️ Disadvantages:**
- Requires accurate prediction of what data will be needed.
- May waste resources on unused refreshes.

**🧰 Use Case:**  
Web apps with predictable access patterns (e.g., trending data, user dashboards).

## 🌐 8. Distributed Caching

When load scales, a single cache can't handle it. So we use multiple caches spread across servers — this is **distributed caching**.

### 🔹 Characteristics
- Cache data spread across multiple nodes.
- Improves scalability and fault tolerance.
- Each node stores part of the total data set.

### 🔹 Benefits
- **Horizontal scalability:** Add more cache nodes for higher capacity.
- **Fault tolerance:** If one cache node fails, others handle the load.
- **Load balancing:** Requests distributed evenly.

### 🔹 Popular Systems
- Redis
- Memcached

## 🧠 9. Cache Coherency (Consistency Between Caches)

When multiple caches (on different cores/nodes) hold the same data, consistency becomes a challenge.

**Cache coherency** ensures that all caches see the same value for the same memory address.

### MESI Protocol
Each cache line can be in one of four states:

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| M (Modified) | Cache line modified; differs from main memory. |
| E (Exclusive) | Cache line present only in this cache; same as main memory. |
| S (Shared) | Cache line unmodified and present in multiple caches. |
| I (Invalid) | Cache line invalid; cannot be used. |

Ensures consistent synchronization between CPU caches.

### MOESI Protocol
Extension of MESI — adds O (Owned) state.

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| O (Owned) | Cache line is shared but one cache "owns" the valid copy. Others may have stale data. |

This reduces redundant writes and optimizes performance for multi-processor systems.

### 🔁 Example of MESI in Action
- Three nodes: A, B, C — all have data D.
- Node A modifies D → D1.
- MESI marks A's line as Modified (M).
- B and C mark their copies as Invalid (I).
- When B or C next request D, they fetch updated data D1.
