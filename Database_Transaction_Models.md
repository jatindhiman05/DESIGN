# üìò Database Transaction Models

## üîπ 1. Introduction

Let's start from the absolute basics.

A **database transaction model** defines how a database manages changes ‚Äî how it executes, commits, rolls back, and ensures reliability even when failures or concurrency issues occur.

**In simple words:**

A transaction model is a set of rules or principles that guide how database operations must behave to maintain data integrity, reliability, and consistency.

## üîπ 2. Real-World Intuition

To understand why we need transaction models, compare these two situations:

| Example | Key Requirement |
|---------|-----------------|
| üí∞ Withdrawing money from an ATM | Must be strongly consistent (data must always be correct) |
| ‚ù§Ô∏è Following someone on Instagram | Can be eventually consistent (temporary delay is acceptable) |

The ATM example can't tolerate even a small inconsistency ‚Äî your money can't vanish or duplicate. But Instagram can ‚Äî for a short time ‚Äî show wrong follower counts without any critical harm.

These two different needs are handled by two transaction philosophies:

- **ACID** ‚Äî prioritizes Consistency
- **BASE** ‚Äî prioritizes Availability

## üîπ 3. Why Transaction Models Exist

When databases perform multiple operations (like updating several tables or accounts), failures or concurrency can cause problems like:

- Partial updates
- Lost data
- Inconsistent states
- Conflicting transactions

To prevent these issues, databases follow transaction models that define:

- How changes are made
- What happens when something fails
- How multiple users' actions interact safely

## üîπ 4. The Two Major Models

| Model | Full Form | Focus |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| ACID | Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability | Strong consistency |
| BASE | Basically Available, Soft State, Eventually Consistent | High availability and scalability |

## ‚öôÔ∏è ACID Model (Traditional / Relational Databases)

The ACID model ensures that database transactions are reliable and consistent even under failure or concurrency.

It's used in systems like:

- Banking
- E-commerce payments
- Reservation systems
- Government databases

Let's break it down.

### üß© 1. Atomicity ‚Äî "All or Nothing"

A transaction is treated as a single indivisible unit. Either all operations succeed, or none do.

**Example ‚Äì Money Transfer (A ‚Üí B)**
Steps:
1. Read A's balance
2. Subtract $100 from A
3. Add $100 to B
4. Write both updates to the database

If any of these steps fail (say, adding to B's account fails), the entire transaction is rolled back, restoring both accounts to their original state.

That's why when your payment "fails", the money always comes back ‚Äî because of Atomicity.

**Summary:**
- No partial execution
- Ensures complete rollback on failure
- Guarantees system safety during interruptions

### üß© 2. Consistency ‚Äî "Valid State to Valid State"

Every transaction must bring the database from one valid state to another, preserving integrity rules and constraints.

**Example:**
If A has $1000 and sends $100 to B,
‚Üí A = $900, B = $100 more.
The total money in the system remains constant.

**Consistency ensures:**
- Data integrity is never broken
- Database rules (like unique keys, foreign keys, constraints) are always followed
- Invalid or incomplete states are never committed

Without consistency, A could lose money without B gaining it ‚Äî which breaks the system's correctness.

### üß© 3. Isolation ‚Äî "Transactions Don't Interfere"

Each transaction runs as if it were the only one being executed.

Even when many transactions run simultaneously, the results must be the same as if they ran one after another.

**Example:**
A and C share a joint account with $100.

A tries to send $80 to B.
C tries to send $50 to D at the same time.

If both succeed simultaneously, they'd overspend ($130 > $100). Isolation prevents that ‚Äî it locks one transaction until the other finishes.

**Real-world analogy:**
Movie ticket booking ‚Äî two users click on the same seat at the same time, but only one succeeds. That's isolation at work.

**Summary:**
- Prevents dirty reads, phantom reads, lost updates
- Uses locks or serialization
- Ensures predictable results under concurrency

### üß© 4. Durability ‚Äî "Committed Means Permanent"

Once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent, even if the system crashes immediately afterward.

**Example:**
After A successfully transfers $100 to B, that record stays in the database ‚Äî even if power goes out or servers crash.

**Durability ensures:**
- Committed data is safely stored (usually in non-volatile memory / logs)
- Recovery mechanisms can restore the state after failures
- No committed transaction is ever lost

## üåê BASE Model (Distributed / NoSQL Systems)

The BASE model is designed for large, distributed, internet-scale systems like Instagram, Netflix, Facebook, Amazon, etc. These systems prioritize availability and scalability over immediate consistency.

### üß© 1. Basically Available

The system remains operational and responsive even if parts of it fail.

Even during network partitions, the application still serves requests ‚Äî though the data might not be 100% accurate at that moment.

**Example:**
You follow a new celebrity on Instagram, and your "Follow" button turns blue immediately. But their follower count might not increase right away. The system is available, even though it's not yet consistent.

**Key Idea:**
- Service remains online during partial failures
- Some features may show stale data
- Prioritizes availability > accuracy

### üß© 2. Soft State

The system accepts that its data may be temporarily inconsistent, and this state will change or stabilize over time.

**Example:**
You see 100K likes on a post, your friend sees 102K ‚Äî both are temporary. The actual number might still be updating across servers.

The system knows it's not final yet ‚Äî it's in a "soft" or "intermediate" state.

**Key Idea:**
- Temporary inconsistencies are okay
- System state evolves automatically
- Data will eventually converge to the correct version

### üß© 3. Eventually Consistent

Over time (once updates propagate), all nodes in the system will reflect the same final data.

**Example:**
You follow someone on Instagram. After a few minutes, everyone (including the celebrity) sees the updated follower count.

Eventual consistency accepts short-term differences for long-term stability.

**Why it matters:**
- Enables high scalability across global data centers
- Reduces response time
- Ensures smooth user experience under heavy load

## ‚öîÔ∏è ACID vs BASE ‚Äî Key Comparison

| Aspect | ACID | BASE |
|--------|------|------|
| Focus | Data consistency | System availability |
| Use Case | Banking, payments, booking systems | Social media, streaming platforms |
| Approach | Strong consistency | Eventual consistency |
| Tolerance | Low tolerance for inconsistency | High tolerance for temporary inconsistency |
| Isolation | Strict, serializable | Loose, accepts concurrent updates |
| Durability | Immediate and permanent | Eventual synchronization |
| Scalability | Vertical (single strong node) | Horizontal (many distributed nodes) |
| Example Systems | MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle | Cassandra, DynamoDB, MongoDB |

## ‚öñÔ∏è When to Use What

### ‚úÖ Choose ACID when:

- Financial, medical, or mission-critical data is involved
- Strong correctness and accuracy are essential
- Failures or inconsistencies are unacceptable

**Examples:** Banking, ticket booking, stock trading, accounting software

### ‚úÖ Choose BASE when:

- The system needs to handle massive scale and global users
- Temporary inconsistency is acceptable
- Availability and speed matter more than perfect accuracy

**Examples:** Instagram, Netflix, Twitter, YouTube, Amazon product pages

## üß† Quick Recap

| Principle | Meaning | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Atomicity | All or nothing | ATM withdrawal |
| Consistency | Valid state to valid state | Bank balance update |
| Isolation | No interference | Movie ticket booking |
| Durability | Permanent once done | Payment success stays recorded |
| Basically Available | Always up | Instagram never goes down |
| Soft State | Temporary inconsistency | Like count differences |
| Eventually Consistent | Becomes consistent over time | Follower count syncs later |

## üèÅ Conclusion

ACID and BASE aren't competitors ‚Äî they're different philosophies for different problems.

- **ACID** ‚Üí Accuracy first  
  *"Better to delay than to be wrong."*

- **BASE** ‚Üí Availability first  
  *"Better to be fast than to be perfect (temporarily)."*

Every modern system chooses a point between these two extremes depending on what matters most: correctness or availability.
