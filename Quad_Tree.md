# 🧠 Quad Tree 

## 1. 🔍 What Is a Quad Tree?

A **Quad Tree** is a tree-based data structure used for partitioning two-dimensional (2D) space. It recursively divides a 2D area into four equal quadrants, or regions, until each subdivision meets certain criteria (like having few enough points, or reaching a minimum size).

Think of it as a **spatial index** — a way to organize points, shapes, or images in 2D so that searches, queries, and updates can be done quickly.

### ✅ Key Idea

- Each internal node represents a rectangular region in space.
- Each node has exactly four children, representing the four quadrants of its region:
  - Top-left (NW)
  - Top-right (NE)
  - Bottom-left (SW)
  - Bottom-right (SE)
- The process continues recursively until a stopping condition is met.

### 🧭 Real-world Analogy

Imagine zooming in on Google Maps:
- At first, you see the entire world — one large square.
- Zoom in — the map divides into smaller tiles (quadrants).
- Zoom in again — each tile splits into four more.
- Keep zooming — you eventually see neighborhoods, streets, then buildings.

Each level of zoom corresponds to one level in a Quad Tree. That's exactly how spatial data like map tiles are managed efficiently.

## 2. 🧩 Structure of a Quad Tree

Each node in a Quad Tree represents:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Region | A rectangular area in 2D space (defined by boundaries: x_min, x_max, y_min, y_max). |
| Points or Data | The objects (points, polygons, pixels, etc.) stored within that region. |
| Children | Four subregions (quadrants) that subdivide the space further if necessary. |

### 🧱 Node Types

**Root Node:**  
Represents the entire space.

**Internal Nodes:**  
Subdivided into 4 quadrants (have 4 children).

**Leaf Nodes:**  
Contain data directly and are not subdivided further. These represent the smallest regions of space.

### 🧮 Spatial Division Example

Let's say we have a square area:
```text
+---------------------+
|          |          |
|   NW     |   NE     |
|          |          |
|----------+----------|
|          |          |
|   SW     |   SE     |
|          |          |
+---------------------+
```

Each of these four quadrants is itself a smaller square — each can become a new node if needed.

## 3. ⚙️ Construction of a Quad Tree

The tree is built recursively.

### Algorithm

**Function: Insert(point, node)**

1. If node is a leaf and has capacity → Add the point to this node.
2. Else if node exceeds capacity → Subdivide node into 4 quadrants (create children).
3. Distribute all existing points into the correct child.
4. Insert the new point into the correct child node.
5. Continue recursively until all points are inserted or min cell size reached.

### 🧠 Termination Conditions (When to Stop Subdividing)

- The node contains fewer than a set number of points (capacity).
- The region becomes smaller than a defined threshold.
- The depth limit of the tree is reached.

## 4. 🔍 Querying a Quad Tree

Quad Trees are excellent for spatial queries — especially when dealing with large 2D datasets.

### a) Point Query

"Does this point exist?" or "What's located at (x, y)?"

**Traverse from the root down:**
1. Determine which quadrant the point lies in.
2. Move into that child node.
3. Continue until a leaf node is reached.
4. If the point is found in that node → ✅ Present.
5. If not → ❌ Absent.

**⏱ Time Complexity:**  
~ O(log n) for balanced trees (faster than scanning all points).

### b) Range Query

"Find all points within this rectangle or circular area."

**Process:**
1. Start at the root.
2. If the query area does not intersect a quadrant → skip it.
3. If it does intersect, recursively search that node.
4. Collect all points that fall within the query region.

**⏱ Time Complexity:**  
~ O(log n + k)  
(n = total points, k = results found)

### c) Nearest Neighbor Query

"Find the closest object to this point."

**Process:**
- Traverse quadrants in order of increasing distance from the query point.
- Use a priority queue or heuristic to prune distant quadrants.

**Common in:** pathfinding (e.g., in games or robotics).

## 5. ⚖️ Balancing a Quad Tree

### Why It Matters

Without balancing, some quadrants could become overloaded — e.g., all points clustered in one small area. This makes the tree deep and inefficient.

### Techniques

- **Adaptive subdivision:** only subdivide dense regions.
- **Merge:** if children become too sparse, merge them back.
- **Capacity tuning:** adjust point threshold per node.

A well-balanced Quad Tree ensures:
- Faster search
- Predictable insertion times
- Minimal wasted memory

## 6. 🧮 Mathematical Characteristics

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Branching factor | 4 (each internal node has 4 children) |
| Height (h) | ~ log₄(n) for n points evenly distributed |
| Space complexity | O(n) average, but can exceed due to empty regions |
| Time complexity (search/insert) | O(log n) average, O(n) worst case if unbalanced |

## 7. 💡 Variants of Quad Trees

| Variant | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Point Quad Tree | Each node stores one point; divisions based on that point's coordinates. |
| Region Quad Tree | The space is subdivided recursively into four equal quadrants regardless of point distribution. |
| PR (Point-Region) Quad Tree | Combines both approaches: each node represents a region and stores points directly. |
| MX Quad Tree | Used in images where all regions subdivide equally to a fixed depth. |

## 9. 🧩 Advantages & Limitations

## 10. 🧠 Visual Summary
```text
Root (entire space)
 ├── NW → subdivide
 ├── NE → subdivide
 ├── SW → subdivide
 └── SE → subdivide
        ├── NW (leaf)
        ├── NE (leaf)
        ├── SW (leaf)
        └── SE (leaf)

```


Each subdivision = deeper zoom level  
Each leaf = smallest region containing final data points.

## 11. 🧰 Real-World Code Example (Conceptual Pseudocode)

```python
class QuadTreeNode:
    def __init__(self, boundary, capacity):
        self.boundary = boundary  # (x_min, x_max, y_min, y_max)
        self.capacity = capacity  # max points before subdividing
        self.points = []
        self.children = []  # NW, NE, SW, SE

    def insert(self, point):
        if not self.contains(point):
            return False

        if len(self.points) < self.capacity and not self.children:
            self.points.append(point)
            return True

        if not self.children:
            self.subdivide()

        for child in self.children:
            if child.insert(point):
                return True
        return False

    def subdivide(self):
        # create 4 child nodes (NW, NE, SW, SE)
        pass
```
This is a simplified version — real implementations optimize memory and range handling heavily.
