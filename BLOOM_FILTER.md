# 🧠 BLOOM FILTER — Complete Notes (From Scratch)

## 🔹 1. What Is a Bloom Filter?

A Bloom Filter is a **probabilistic data structure** used to test whether an element is a member of a set.

- It can tell you with **certainty** if an element is **not present**.
- It can tell you with **some probability** if an element **might be present**.
- It never gives **false negatives**, but can give **false positives**.

**In short:**
> "If Bloom Filter says NO — the element is definitely not in the set.  
> If Bloom Filter says YES — the element might be in the set."

## 🔹 2. Why Do We Need It?

Imagine you have a set with millions of elements (URLs, IPs, cached files, etc.), and you need to check membership (is X in the set?).

**Typical methods:**

| Method | Space | Time | Drawback |
|--------|-------|------|----------|
| HashSet / Hashtable | High | O(1) | High memory cost |
| List / Array | Moderate | O(n) | Slow lookup |
| Trie / Tree | Moderate | O(log n) | Complex |

Now, in systems like web caches, spam filters, or network routers, we often only need to know whether an element might exist before we go fetch or store it.

→ Bloom Filter gives you a **fast, memory-efficient** way to test membership.

## 🔹 3. The Core Idea

A Bloom Filter uses:
- A **Bit Array** of size `m` (all bits initialized to 0).
- **k Independent Hash Functions** (each outputs a number between 0 and m-1).

## 🔹 4. The Two Operations

### ✅ (A) Insertion

To insert an element `x`:
1. Compute `k` hash values:  
   `h1(x), h2(x), …, hk(x)`
2. For each hash output, set the corresponding bit in the array to 1.

**Example:**
```
m = 10 bits, k = 3 hash functions
Insert "apple"
h1("apple") = 2
h2("apple") = 5
h3("apple") = 8

Bit array before: 0000000000
Bit array after: 0010010010


```


### 🔍 (B) Query (Membership Check)

To check if `y` is in the set:
1. Compute the same `k` hash values.
2. Check if all corresponding bits are 1.
   - If all are 1 → **possibly present**
   - If any is 0 → **definitely not present**

## 🔹 5. Visual Representation

Let's take a 10-bit array (indices 0–9):

| Index | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |
|-------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Bit | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |

If you query an element:
- All hash positions are 1 → **maybe present**
- Any position is 0 → **definitely absent**

## 🔹 6. False Positives and Negatives

### ⚠️ False Positive:
Occurs when Bloom Filter says an element is present, but it's actually not.

**Why?**  
Different elements may hash to the same bit positions.

**Example:**
- Inserted: "apple", "banana"
- Query: "grape"
- "grape" hashes to bits already set by "apple" or "banana" → falsely appears as present.

### ✅ No False Negatives:
If any bit required by an element is 0, it means that element was never inserted.

## 🔹 7. Mathematical Foundation

**Let:**
- `m` = number of bits in array
- `n` = number of inserted elements
- `k` = number of hash functions

**After inserting n elements:**

Probability a bit is still 0:  
`p₀ = (1 - 1/m)^(kn)`

Probability a bit is 1:  
`p₁ = 1 - p₀ = 1 - (1 - 1/m)^(kn)`

**False Positive Probability (Pₙ):**  
`P_fp = (p₁)^k = [1 - (1 - 1/m)^(kn)]^k`

For large m, approximate as:  
`P_fp ≈ (1 - e^(-kn/m))^k`

## 🔹 8. Optimal Parameters

### ✅ Optimal Number of Hash Functions
To minimize false positives:  
`k = (m/n) × ln(2)`

### ✅ False Positive Rate for Optimal k
`P_fp = (0.6185)^(m/n)`

**Interpretation:**
- Increasing m/n (bits per element) reduces false positives exponentially.
- Doubling the bit array drastically improves accuracy.

## 🔹 9. Space and Time Complexity

| Operation | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------|
| Insert | O(k) ≈ O(1) | O(m) bits |
| Query | O(k) ≈ O(1) | O(m) bits |

Since k is constant, both operations are constant-time.

## 🔹 10. Real-World Applications

### ⚡ 1. Caching Systems
Before checking in cache (expensive), ask Bloom Filter:
- If filter says "not present" → skip lookup (save time)
- If "maybe present" → do actual lookup

**Used in:**
- Web caching (browsers, CDNs)
- Databases (Redis, Cassandra, HBase)

### 📖 2. Spell Checkers
Each dictionary word is hashed and inserted. When you type a word:
- If Bloom Filter says "not present" → instantly mark misspelled
- If "maybe present" → do detailed check (saves time)

### 🌐 3. Networking / Routers
Used in packet forwarding:
- Check if destination IP exists in routing table
- Avoid costly lookups in huge routing tables

### 📧 4. Spam Filtering
Check if sender/email hash matches known spam patterns quickly.

### 🧩 5. Database Joins and Query Optimization
Used in distributed databases to avoid unnecessary data transfer when joining huge tables.

## 🔹 11. Implementation Considerations

### (A) Hash Functions
- Should be independent and uniformly distributed.
- Bad hashing → clustered bits → higher false positives.
- Often implemented using double hashing:  
  `h_i(x) = h₁(x) + i⋅h₂(x)`  
  (to derive multiple hashes efficiently)

### (B) Bit Array Size
- Larger array = fewer collisions = lower false positives.
- But uses more memory.
- Trade-off between memory and accuracy.

### (C) Dynamic Resizing
Normal Bloom Filters are static — they don't resize.  
To handle growing data:
- Use **Scalable Bloom Filters** → maintain multiple Bloom filters, each with increasing size and decreasing false positive rate.

### (D) Deletion Problem
You cannot delete from a standard Bloom filter (because multiple elements may have set the same bits).

**Solution:**  
Use a **Counting Bloom Filter** — store integer counters instead of bits.  
When inserting → increment counters, when deleting → decrement.

## 🔹 12. Variants of Bloom Filters

| Variant | Key Feature | Use Case |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Counting Bloom Filter | Supports deletion | Dynamic datasets |
| Scalable Bloom Filter | Dynamically grows | Streams, changing data |
| Partitioned Bloom Filter | Divides bit array per hash | Reduces correlation |
| Compressed Bloom Filter | Uses compression to save space | Low-bandwidth systems |
| Cuckoo Filter | Alternative allowing deletion | High-performance caching |

## 🔹 13. Practical Design Tips

- Choose `m ≈ 10 × n` bits for <1% false positives.
- Use 5–7 hash functions typically.
- Hash functions like MurmurHash, xxHash, or SHA-1 (for security-sensitive tasks) are good options.
- Avoid re-hashing strings repeatedly — cache hash results if needed.

## 🔹 14. Example Walkthrough

**Let's simulate:**

```
m = 10 bits, k = 3
Initially: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

Insert "cat":
h1=2, h2=4, h3=6 → set bits 2,4,6 → [0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0]

Insert "dog":
h1=3, h2=6, h3=9 → set bits 3,6,9 → [0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1]

Query "cat": bits 2,4,6 → all 1 → possibly present
Query "rat": h1=1, h2=4, h3=9 → bits 1,4,9 → all 1 → false positive possible

```

## 🔹 17. Real-World Example — Google Bigtable

Google's Bigtable uses Bloom Filters to:
- Check if a key is likely in an SSTable before reading from disk.
- Skip unnecessary disk I/O → massive speedup on large distributed data.

## 🔹 18. Key Takeaways

- **Deterministic NO, Probabilistic YES.**
- Use when you need fast, memory-efficient membership checking.
- Tune `m`, `n`, and `k` based on expected load and acceptable false positive rate.
- Can't delete → use Counting Bloom Filter if needed.
- Perfect for distributed, cache, or network-heavy systems.
