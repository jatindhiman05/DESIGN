# 📘 Data Warehousing 
## 🧠 1. What Is Data Warehousing?

**Definition:**
A data warehouse is a centralized repository designed to collect, store, integrate, and analyze large amounts of data from multiple heterogeneous sources for business intelligence (BI), analytics, and strategic decision-making.

Think of it as the "central brain" of an organization's data ecosystem — it doesn't just store raw data; it transforms it into meaningful, consistent, and query-ready information.

### 💡 Real-World Analogy:

Imagine a national warehouse for a retail chain. Every store (Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, etc.) sends its daily sales data to this central warehouse. Now the company's CEO can:
- See total sales per day
- Compare performance across stores
- Predict which city might sell the most next month

That central warehouse of all store data = Data Warehouse in computing.

### 🔑 Key Characteristics

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Subject-Oriented | Organized around major business subjects (sales, customers, inventory, etc.), not applications |
| Integrated | Combines data from multiple, inconsistent sources (ERP, CRM, logs, APIs) into a unified schema |
| Non-Volatile | Once loaded, data is stable; only appended with new data — not frequently updated or deleted |
| Time-Variant | Stores historical data (weeks, months, years) to track trends and patterns over time |

## 🧩 2. Why Do Organizations Need Data Warehousing?

| Reason | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| Single Source of Truth (SSOT) | Consolidates scattered data into one reliable version |
| Historical Analysis | Stores years of data for long-term trend and performance analysis |
| Faster Query Performance | Optimized for read-heavy analytical queries, unlike OLTP systems |
| Supports Business Intelligence | Feeds data to dashboards, KPIs, reports, and data visualization tools |
| Strategic Decision-Making | Enables predictive modeling and proactive strategy using past behavior |

## 🏗️ 3. Types of Data Warehouses

### 3.1. Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW)
**Scope:** Organization-wide, centralized  
**Purpose:** Integrates data from all departments (sales, finance, marketing, etc.)  
**Benefits:**
- Cross-department insights
- Unified analytics and consistency
- Eliminates data silos

**📘 Example:** Amazon's company-wide data platform analyzing orders, supply chain, and customer behavior globally

### 3.2. Data Mart
**Scope:** Department-specific (subset of EDW)  
**Purpose:** Serves focused analytical needs (e.g., Marketing, HR)  
**Types:**
- **Dependent Data Mart:** Extracted from central EDW
- **Independent Data Mart:** Built directly from source data

**Benefits:**
- Faster and easier deployment
- Customized for a smaller user base
- Reduces query complexity

**📘 Example:** A "Sales Data Mart" only containing data relevant to sales KPIs and targets

### 3.3. Operational Data Store (ODS)
**Scope:** Near-real-time data layer between OLTP and DW  
**Purpose:** Provides up-to-date, consolidated data for operational decisions  
**Usage:** Used where immediate decisions are required (e.g., fraud detection)

**📘 Example:** Bank's ODS updating customer balance instantly after a transaction, before syncing to DW at night

## 🧱 4. Data Warehouse Architecture

A **3-Tier Architecture**:

### 🔹 1️⃣ Bottom Tier — Data Layer
- Actual storage layer containing the data warehouse database
- Data is cleansed, transformed, and indexed
- Usually resides on RDBMS, columnar databases, or data lakes
- **Examples:** Snowflake, Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, Teradata

### 🔹 2️⃣ Middle Tier — Application / OLAP Layer
- Handles query processing, business logic, and data transformation
- Supports OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) cubes for multidimensional analysis
- **Tools:** Microsoft SSAS, IBM Cognos, Oracle OLAP, Pentaho

### 🔹 3️⃣ Top Tier — Presentation Layer
- The front-end where business users interact with the data
- Provides visualization, dashboards, and reports
- **Tools:** Power BI, Tableau, Looker, QlikView

### 🔧 Additional Components

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Metadata Repository | Stores info about the data (sources, schema, transformation rules) |
| Staging Area | Temporary space for cleaning & transformation before final loading |
| Data Warehouse Appliance | Pre-configured combination of hardware + software (e.g., Teradata, Netezza) |
| Cloud Data Warehouse | Managed cloud solutions (e.g., Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift) for scalability and low maintenance |

## ⚙️ 5. ETL Process (Extract – Transform – Load)

ETL is the core data pipeline that prepares and feeds data into the warehouse.

### Step 1: Extract
Pull data from multiple heterogeneous sources:
- Databases (MySQL, Oracle)
- APIs, Logs
- Flat files (CSV, JSON)
- Cloud services

**Types:**
- **Full Extraction:** Pulls all data each time
- **Incremental Extraction:** Pulls only changes since last load

### Step 2: Transform
Cleanses, standardizes, and formats the extracted data.

| Subprocess | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Data Cleaning | Remove duplicates, fix missing values, correct inconsistencies |
| Data Validation | Enforce integrity (e.g., correct data types, valid keys) |
| Data Mapping | Align fields from different schemas into unified columns |
| Aggregation | Summarize (e.g., total monthly sales) |
| Standardization | Uniform units, time zones, formats, naming |

### Step 3: Load
Push the cleaned, transformed data into the target DW.

**Load strategies:**
- **Full Load:** Replaces all existing data
- **Incremental Load:** Adds only new or changed records

**May include:**
- Indexing for fast search
- Partitioning for efficient access
